# Pandas-Project-1
First project in learning Python Pandas for data analysis. Cleaned and analyzed sales data from an electronics store, performing tasks like handling missing values, type conversions, and exploring key insights (e.g., top-selling products). Used techniques like pd.concat, .apply(), groupby(), and matplotlib.
