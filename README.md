# Project-1: Pandas Sales Data Analysis

## Overview
In this project, we use **Python Pandas** and **Matplotlib** to clean, explore, and visualize sales data from an electronics store. The project answers business-related questions based on 12 months of sales data.

## Main Tasks
- **Data Cleaning**: Handle missing values and perform type conversions.
- **Data Exploration**: Answer key business questions such as identifying the best month for sales, top-selling products, and more.
- **Data Visualization**: Use **Matplotlib** to create bar charts and line graphs.

## Techniques Used
- **Pandas**: `pd.concat()`, `groupby()`, `.apply()`, `.str()`
- **Matplotlib**: For visualizing the results
   
## Business Questions Explored
1. What was the best month for sales?
2. Which city sold the most products?
